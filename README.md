# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
This project was intended to display to several items. Given our data, we filtered down to a parent category (theater) and the filtered down to its sub category (plays). From there we wanted to visualize our data by creating a pivot chart that displays what month were plays most likely to succeed, fail, or be canceled. This calculation was made by comparing their funding goal and how much was pledged by a given date. From there, we created an easy to read line chart that concludes May is the month plays are most likely to succeed in their funding goal. 

continuously, we wanted to know the number of successful, failed, and canceled plays based on how large their spending goal was. We broke out the amounts starting from less than a thousand and went in increments of four thousand nine hundred and ninety-nine until we stopped at fifty-thousand or more. We were able to get our numbers using the COUNTIFS function Excel provides. From there, we calculated the total number of projects in each spend goal category using the SUM function and then determining the percentage of successful, failed, and canceled based on their spending goal. From there, we created an easy to read line chart with percentages on the Y-axis and their spend goal on the X-axis. 

### Purpose

The purpose of this project was to visualize for Louise which month were plays most likely to succeed and how likely were plays to succeed based on their spending goal ask. It also visualizes the data for Louise so she can see which months were plays least likely to succeed and how much goal was to much to ask for if she wanted one of her plays to be successful. 

## Analysis and Challenges

I was able to complete this challenege by creating simple to read pivot table and easy to read to charts. The only challeneges that i faced was how to use the COUNTIFS function with multiple criteria on the Outcomes_Based_on_Goals tab of the spread sheet. I was able to get past this hurdle by using the hint video in Module 1 challenge. The page that this video is housed on is linked below.

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

The pivot table and line chart concludes May is the month plays are most likely to succeed in their funding goal. On the other hand, we can see that December is the least likely a play will succeed based on our pivot table and pivot chart. 


- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

We can conclude that if Louise asks for a budget of $45,000 to $49,999 that there is a 100% chance that the she will fail to reach her goal. 

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

I thin the limitation that stood out to me when creating both the outcomes by launch date and the outcomes by goals was that there was no instruction to filter it down to just a certain country. Louise is getting this data for every country that has a Kickstarter for theater and plays. 

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?

we could easily create either a vertical or horizontal bar chart that would visualize this data in the exact same way.
